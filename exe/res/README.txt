** What is ONLYOFFICE Document Builder? **
  ONLYOFFICE Document Builder allows you to build a document easily 
without the need to actually run a document processing editor. It also 
allows the developers to automate document building using the 
templates you create or inserting the data from some database of yours 
into a document or a set of documents. It has all the features of a 
common document editor but is lightweight and can be easily integrated 
into your document management system, CRM system, etc. using its 
JavaScript API.
  As any document is a composite object consisting of a tree of larger 
nodes (paragraphs and tables), where it is possible to insert smaller 
document elements (text runs, images, charts, shapes), ONLYOFFICE 
Document Builder allows to insert the content and format it to your 
liking quickly and easily.
    
** How it works? **
  As any document is a composite object consisting of a tree of larger 
nodes (paragraphs and tables), where it is possible to insert smaller 
document elements (text runs, images, charts, shapes), ONLYOFFICE 
Document Builder allows to insert the content and format it to your 
liking quickly and easily.

To launch ONLYOFFICE Document Builder run the following command:
    docbuilder.exe mydocument

Here docbuilder.exe is the name of ONLYOFFICE Document Builder 
(together with the path, if the command is run from the folder 
different from where the executive is placed) executive file, and the 
mydocument parameter is the name (again, together with the path, if 
needed) of the script file that will form the document contents.


** Building the first document **
  Before you start building your first document, you need a script 
file where all the document contents and formatting will be described. 
This file will be used by ONLYOFFICE Document Builder to build the 
document. Please see the sample document files or examples of 
ONLYOFFICE Document Builder files in the program documentation.


** Using ONLYOFFICE Document Builder document samples **
  If you want to try ONLYOFFICE Document Builder in action and do not 
know where to start, you can use the sample files for documents 
included into the installation of ONLYOFFICE Document Builder. The 
sample files are available in the 'Examples' folder of the 
installation directory. The examples use the following path by 
default: ./TESTFILES. Please do not forget to edit them to specify the 
output folder for the resulting document files or create the folder 
for the output files for the program to build them correctly.


** Registering ONLYOFFICE Document Builder **
  Before you start using full featured ONLYOFFICE Document Builder,
you need to register it. You can buy the registration key from
onlyoffice web site - http://onlyoffice.com/document-builder.aspx
After you pay for your license, you will receive the key by email.
Copy it, go to the installed ONLYOFFICE Document Builder folder,
run the Registration file, enter the received key into the field
and press 'OK'. From that time on you can use all the features of
ONLYOFFICE Document Builder.


** ONLYOFFICE Document Builder API documentation **
  ONLYOFFICE Document Builder API documentation is available at the 
http://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/developers/document-builder/index.aspx 
address. It contains all the classes and methods available in 
ONLYOFFICE Document Builder API and the examples of use for each 
method.
